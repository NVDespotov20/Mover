This is a game me and my team are developing for a school project featuring a Player who is trying to escape a puzzel prison by moving boxes to press buttons! But he has to be careful! If he runs out of stamina he will pass out and guards will put him back in the first room! To make the game we use only c++ and the

and 
<a href="https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/">SDL2_image</a>
libraries.
